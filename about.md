I play the oboe, dogs > cats, and I like to watch soccer games every so often, but I do NOT keep up with the teams and players. My favorite programming languages are Python, Go, and if the situation calls for it, Julia.

### More Information

I have a casual interest in cyber security, rocketry, and political science.

I'm not enthusiastic about social media, I figure if I'm going to waste my own time, I'd rather not make Zuckerberg rich off of it.

Also, I am always up for a Rubik's cube solving challenge, email below.
